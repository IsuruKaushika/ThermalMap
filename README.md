# 2D Temperature and Distance Scanner

This Arduino-based project scans a 2D grid to measure temperature and distance using MLX90614 and VL53L0X sensors. The data is collected as the stepper motors move across the grid.

## Features
- Measures temperature using MLX90614.
- Measures distance using VL53L0X.
- Controlled by two stepper motors for X and Y axes.
- Homing functionality using limit switches.
- Data logging for each grid point.

## Components
- Arduino-compatible microcontroller.
- Stepper motors with drivers.
- MLX90614 Infrared Temperature Sensor.
- VL53L0X Distance Sensor.
- Limit switches.

## Usage
1. Connect the components as per the schematic.
2. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
3. Monitor the output via the serial monitor.
